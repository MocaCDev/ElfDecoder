ELF Program Header:
    A program header table is an array of structures, each describing a segment or other information the system needs to
    prepare the program for execution.
    An object file segment contains one or more sections.
    Program Headers are meaningful only for executable and shared object files.

    `p_align` in `ProgramHeader`:
        If the value is not 0 or 1, `p_align` should be a positive, integral power of 2, and `p_virtual_address` should equal `p_offset`, modulo `p_align`.
